			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to help people practice music theory skills. It will have pages that
                help users to identify, chors, notes, intervals, etc. both aurally and visually. 
            </p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience will be people who know music theory who want to practice the skills that they have learned.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>My JavaScript file will primarily be designed to help the site to function as intended. For example,
                it will randomly select notes to test the user with. It will also handle the logic for playing notes
                and intervals and checking to make sure user's answers are correct. 
            </p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c"
				target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>

						<td class="primary">[#4a90e2]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#ffffff]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#ffb347]</td>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;
				I like the soft and slightly fun vibe of this font, which is why I decided to use it.
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Arial
				I chose this font because it is basic, yet still inviting
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate
				velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint
				occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
				mollit anim id est laborum.
			</p>
			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
			<p class="colored">

			</p>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Page2</a>
				<a href="#">Page3</a>
			</nav>
			<hr />

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>The home page will mostly contain links to the other pages. This site is a lot more about functionality than text or image content.</p>
			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>The lesson about recognizing notes visually will have many images of a note on a staff that the user will recognize and name. </p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about home that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="wireframe1.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="wireframe2.png" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
